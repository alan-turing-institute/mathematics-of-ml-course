    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical session we consider the problem of *model selection aggregation* comprised of a finite dictionary of functions $\\mathcal{A} = \\{a_{i} : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y} : i = 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $n$ data points $Z_{i} = (X_{i}, Y_{i}) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ sampled i.i.d. from some unknown distribution $P$. An aggregation procedure aims to output an *aggregate* function $A = A(Z_{1}, \\dots, Z_{n}) : \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\to \\mathcal{Y}$ that performs as well as the best function in $\\mathcal{A}$ in the sense described below. We will restrict our attention to aggregation procedures constrained to produce convex combinations of elements of $\\mathcal{A}$. That is, each function $A = A(Z_{1}, \\dots, Z_{n})$ can be uniquely identified by a vector\n",
    "$W = W(Z_{1}, \\dots, Z_{n}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  A = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} W_{i}a_{i} = a_{W}\n",
    "  \\quad\\text{such that}\\quad\n",
    "  \\sum_{i=1}^{m} W_{i} = 1 \\text{ and }\n",
    "  W_{i} \\geq 0 \\text{ for all }i=1,\\dots,m.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we identify the output of an aggregation procedure by a vector $W = W(Z_{1}, \\dots, Z_{n})$. In addition, we identify each function $a_{i} \\in \\mathcal{A}$ via a standard basis vector $e_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ (i.e., a vector whose $i$-th element equals $1$ while all the other elements equal $0$). In particular, $a_{i} = a_{e_{i}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Measures of Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical session we only consider the quadratic loss function $\\ell(a, Z) = (a(X) - Y)^{2}$. Recall that the aim of an aggregate $W$ is to predict as well as the best function in $\\mathcal{A}$. Henceforth, the quality of an aggregation procedure $W$ is measured by its *estimation error* $\\mathcal{E}_{n, \\mathcal{A}, P}(W)$ defined as\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathcal{E}_{n,P,\\mathcal{A}}(W)\n",
    "  &=\n",
    "  r(a_{W}) - \\min_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} r(a)\n",
    "  \\\\\n",
    "  &=\n",
    "  \\mathbf{E}_{Z \\sim P}[(a_{W}(X) - Y)^{2} \\vert Z_{1}, \\dots, Z_{n}]\n",
    "  -  \\min_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\mathbf{E}_{Z \\sim P}[(a(X) - Y)^{2}].\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "When $n$, $P$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ are clear from the context, we will use the shorthand notation $\\mathcal{E}(W) = \\mathcal{E}_{n,P,\\mathcal{A}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will study two different measures of quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *In-expectation performance.* The first measure of quality concerns understanding *average* performance of an estimator $W$: given an aggregation procedure $W$ we want to obtain upper bounds $\\Delta_{n,m}^{\\mathrm{EX}}$ on its expected estimation error\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mathbf{E}_{Z_{1}^{n}}[\\mathcal{E}_{n,P,\\mathcal{A}}(W)] \\leq \\Delta_{n,m}^{\\mathrm{EX}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $Z_{1}^{n}$ denotes the observed sample $Z_{1}, \\dots, Z_{n}$.\n",
    "Note that the terms $\\Delta_{n,m}^{\\mathrm{EX}}$ should only depend on the sample size $n$ and the dictionary size $m$. In particular, we want to obtain performance guarantees that hold for any distribution $P$ and any dictionary of the given size $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *In-deviations performance*. The second measure of quality concerns understanding the tail behaviour of $\\mathcal{E}_{n,P,\\mathcal{A}}$. Given a confidence parameter $\\delta$ and an aggregation procedure $W$ we want to obtain upper bounds $\\Delta_{n,m,\\delta}^{\\mathrm{PR}}$ that satisfy the following inequality\n",

    "  \\tag{1}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimax Optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence $(\\Delta^{\\mathrm{EX}}_{n,m})$ is called an (in-expectation) *minimax optimal rate* of model selection aggregation aggregation if the following two conditions hold:\n",
    "1. There exists an absolute constant $c_{1}$ such that for any dictionary size $m$ the following holds:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\inf_{W} \\sup_{P, \\mathcal{A} : |\\mathcal{A}| = m} \\mathbf{E}_{Z_{1}^{n}}[\\mathcal{E}_{n,P,\\mathcal{A}}(W)]\n",
    "  \\geq c_{1}\n",
    "  \\Delta_{n,m}^{\\mathrm{EX}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "  The above infimum is taken over all possible aggregation procedures while the above supremum is taken over all possible distributions $P$ supported on $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y}$ and all dictionaries $\\mathcal{A}$ of size $m$ of functions mapping $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathcal{Y}$.\n",
    "2. There exists an absolute constant $c_{2}$ and an aggregation procedure $W$ such that for any dictionary size $m$ and any distribution $P$ the following holds:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mathbf{E}_{Z_{1}^{n}}[\\mathcal{E}_{n,P,\\mathcal{A}}(W)] \\leq c_{2}\n",
    "  \\Delta_{n,m}^{\\mathrm{EX}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bounded setting with $\\mathcal{Y} = [-1, 1]$ the in-expectation minimax optimal rate is equal to \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\tag{2}\n",
    "  \\Delta_{n,M}^{\\mathrm{EX}} = \\frac{\\log m}{n}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "We will call any aggregation procedure $W$ that attains this rate *expectation-optimal*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we say that an aggregation procedure $W$ is *deviation-optimal* if there exists some absolute constant $c$ such that $W$ satisfies $(1)$ with\n",

    "does not exactly match the notion of estimation error introduced in the lectures. In the lectures, the estimation error was defined only for *proper* learning algorithms &mdash; algorithms that always output a function from the set $\\mathcal{A}$. Thus, for the model selection aggregation problem, an estimator $W$ is proper if and only if it always outputs one of the basis vectors $\\{e_{1}, \\dots, e_{m}\\}$. A canonical example of such an estimator is the empirical risk minimization algorithm that we will explore in the exercises below. In contrast to proper estimators, an estimator that is allowed to output a function outside of the reference class of functions $\\mathcal{A}$ is called *improper*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='green'>**Improper estimators have recently been attracting more and more attention in the literature, since such procedures can offer both computational and statistical advantages. One of the goals of this practical session is to demonstrate a simple scenario where achieving minimax optimal rates is only possible via improper estimators.**</font>"

Recall, however, that the notion of optimality introduced in the introduction requires that the rate $O(\\log m/n)$ holds *uniformly* over all problems $(P, \\mathcal{A})$ and thus we cannot yet conclude that the empirical risk minimization estimator is expectation-optimal.\n",

    "## Bibliographic Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of model selection aggregation, among closely related problems of convex and linear aggregation, were studied in the context of non-parametric statistics by *Nemirovski [2000]*. Minimax optimal rates of aggregation for all three problems were established by *Tsybakov [2003]*; see the book by *Tsybakov [2008]* for an introduction to the techniques used to prove information-theoretic lower bounds. In statistics literature, the exponential weights algorithm was used for the model selection aggregation problem, among others, by *Catoni [1997]* and *Yang [2004]*. The exponential weights algorithm itself, however, has much older roots in sequential prediction and game theory; see the textbook by *Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi [2006]* for historical remarks and further references. It was first established that the exponential weights algorithm is deviation suboptimal by *Audibert [2008]*, where the first deviation-optimal procedure was proposed. Further deviation-optimal procedures\n",
    "were introduced by *Lecué and Mendelson [2009], Lecué and Rigollet [2014]* and *Wintenberger [2017]*.\n",
